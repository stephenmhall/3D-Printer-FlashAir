web based uploads to FlashAir SD card in 3D Printer

The card is setup first with the mobile app to connect to your network.

Copy all the files and folders into the hidden folder SD_WLAN on the card. Currently allows viewing contents, uploading new files and changing the wifi config if you go to http://myflashair/SD_WLAN/config.htm I am planning to add a button for that.

I have buttons and code to delete files but so far the HTML and javascript is beyond me. If anyone feels like getting that working that would be great.
